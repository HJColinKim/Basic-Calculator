# Calculator 
A very simple javascript project: a functional simple calculator

The calculator supports both the use of keyboard presses to carry out calculations, as well as manually pressing the buttons on screen using the mouse.

So the user can comfortably use whichever input-type they would like. A combination of both if they wish! Any form of invalid input or calculation will clear the 
calculator immediately, ensuring that no errors will occur.
